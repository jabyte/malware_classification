#In these situations the main constraint is the lack of providing YOUR views to the audience. It comes with practice, don't worry.
#A negative point is that you didn't correct the GRAMMAR mistakes. Think about it: each slide is shown for approx. 1.5 - 2 mins, plenty of time for the wondering eye to spot the mistakes. I mention it since it is important, it gives a first ... second ... impression.
#As for the work:

#- could you FOCUS on JULIA and provide a MODULE  (set of functions collected together) that:
# 1. READS IN AN ASM file (make sure it only reads in the actual instructions and not the ADDRESSES, the SEGMENT NAMES, of the HEXA codes that were considered for the disassembly),
# 2. TOKENISES the information that was read in, by tokenisation I mean that the WORDS are grouped and saved,

#Please consider that you might use any code that you find online PROVIDED THAT YOU:
# 1. clearly cite it (author, date of download, source link),
# 2. ANY CHANGE that you make is written on a separate file.

#Could you please provide a DEADLINE for the TASKS above?
#Lawan: PLEASE PROVIDE FEEDBACK and work together with Jabir on the issue of reading in data (your case is the images and the labels you collected).

#Looking forward for these results,
#L.
